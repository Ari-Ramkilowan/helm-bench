Training team begin drafting user manuals. Budget implications TBD - will discuss in Monday's leadership meeting."}
{"input_text": "Hi Lisa, Thanks for sending the draft marketing campaign. Overall direction looks good but I have a few concerns. The messaging feels too technical for our target audience - can we simplify the language? Also, the color scheme doesn't align with our brand guidelines. Please revise and send back by Wednesday. I'd like to review it once more before we present to the CMO on Friday. The budget is approved so we can move forward once the creative is finalized. Thanks, Jennifer"}
